sftpBackup

Purpose:

Create a python utility to sync files in a folder with a remote server.



In progress:

* Sync files once to a specified remote server.
* Store settings and credentials in a json file.
* Create a GUI to interact with the backup utility.
* Thread the utility so it can run even when the GUI is closed.


Future plans/ideas:

* Setup a server of our own and allow people to backup to it.
* Setup a website to allow people to register for our server.
* Automatically setup a cron task for periodic updates.
* Testing/cross platform support.
* Unit tests.
